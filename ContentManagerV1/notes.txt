have three directories:

- fileInfoXml
- dirInfoXml
- objectFiles

also maybe a temp directory for building directory xml, probably skip, as will do in database later anyway.

Migration:

1) Tool to combine all xml files - move from original place?

2) Tool to combine all dir files (may already have) - again, move, but no necessary to move

3) Tool to combine all object files

Sorting:

1) took to extract all files for each type into specific object store. Object files only.
