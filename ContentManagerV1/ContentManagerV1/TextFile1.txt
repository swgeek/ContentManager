- seperate directories for object store and directory structure. Want to be able to combine object store but have multiple directories. 
Should be able to copy this elsewhere for compare, e.g. online.

- provide means to have list of hash values so can check for duplicates when away from object store.

- how to handle permissions problems?
  maybe have an "invalid hash" value, link files to that, note in Xml if permissions problem.
